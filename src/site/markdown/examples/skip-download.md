### Install From Local Distribution

Nightly builds are not necessarily available indefinitely, and you may find from time to time that you need to use a version that has been superseded by a newer release or is otherwise no longer found on the [builds page](http://www.smartclient.com/builds/).  In this case, the plugin can be made to look locally for a distribution: 
    
1. If necessary, create a directory that [looks like](../apidocs/com/isomorphic/maven/mojo/AbstractPackagerMojo.html#skipDownload) one the plugin would have created for you.

        export WORKDIR = /tmp/SmartGWT/PowerEdition/4.1d/2013-11-25/zip
        mkdir $WORKDIR

2. Drop a copy of the file/s in question where the plugin can find it

        cp /downloads/smartgwtee-4.1d_11-25-2013.zip $WORKDIR

3. Use the [skipDownload](../apidocs/com/isomorphic/maven/mojo/AbstractPackagerMojo.html#skipDownload) property to cause resolution from the local file system.  Note that the value of the -Dworkdir argument is set to the /tmp, as in the path above.

        mvn isc:install -Dproduct=SMARTGWT \
                        -Dlicense=EVAL \
                        -DbuildNumber=4.1d \
                        -DbuildDate=2013-11-25 \
                        -Dworkdir=/tmp \
                        -DskipDownload=true
